This package helps you organize debates between a few people
right inside your documents:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\scriptsize
\raggedcolumns
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{debate}
\begin{document}
I think apples are tastier
\debate[Jeff]{I don't think it's true!}
\debate[Anna]{It is indeed true!}
than pears!

And I don't want to argue with me.
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\columnbreak

I think apples are tastier
\debate[Jeff]{I don't think it's true!}
\debate[Anna]{It is indeed true!}
than pears!

And I don't want to argue with me.
\end{multicols}

You can hide them all using \ff{hide} package option.

More details about this package you can find
in the \ff{yegor256/debate} GitHub repository.
